## Architecture


## Installation

### Foundry

First run the command below to get `foundryup`, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

If you do not want to use the redirect, feel free to manually download the
foundryup installation script from
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gakonst/foundry/master/foundryup/install).

Then, in a new terminal session or after reloading your `PATH`, run it to get
the latest `forge` and `cast` binaries:

```sh
foundryup
```

Advanced ways to use `foundryup`, and other documentation, can be found in the
[foundryup package](./foundryup/README.md). Happy forging!
